Frequency measurement device driver

After building and installing, the frequency in Hz can be read from /dev/freq.

Module paramaters:
	gpio_pin	frequency is measured on this pin (default 17)
	min_freq	minimum expected frequency to be measured (default 5 kHz)
	max_freq	maximum expected frequency to be measured (default 10 kHz)

Special care is taken to handle signals with glitchy edges by recording both rising and falling edges. Signal periods that are not between min_freq and max_freq are ignored.
